# User Deletion and Ban System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive user deletion and ban system implemented in the Safe Companion project. The system uses soft deletion for user accounts and provides robust handling of banned users, ensuring data integrity and proper booking management.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Soft Delete System
- **Database Field**: `deleted` Boolean column in User model (default: False)
- **Behavior**: When a user is deleted, their account is marked as deleted but not removed from the database
- **Booking Impact**: All pending/confirmed bookings are automatically cancelled
- **Access**: Deleted users cannot log in or appear in browse results

### 2. Ban System
- **Database Field**: `active` Boolean column in User model (default: True)
- **Behavior**: When `active=False`, the user is considered banned
- **Booking Impact**: All pending/confirmed bookings are automatically cancelled
- **Access**: Banned users cannot log in or appear in browse results

### 3. Admin Panel Features
- **Separate Sections**: Active users and banned users are displayed in separate sections
- **Action Buttons**: 
  - Delete: Soft deletes user and cancels their bookings
  - Ban/Unban: Toggles user ban status and manages bookings
- **Feedback**: Shows number of bookings cancelled when actions are performed
- **Visual Indicators**: Different styling for active vs banned users

## Technical Implementation

### Database Model (User)
```python
class User(db.Model):
    # Core fields
    active = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=True, nullable=False)     # Ban status
    deleted = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False, nullable=False)   # Soft delete
    
    # Helper methods
    def is_available(self):
        """Check if user account is available (not deleted and active)"""
        return not self.deleted and self.active
    
    def get_display_name(self):
        """Get display name for user - shows 'Deleted User' if account is deleted"""
        if self.deleted:
            return "Deleted User"
        return self.profile.name if self.profile else self.email.split('@')[0]
    
    def get_account_status(self):
        """Get user account status as a string"""
        if self.deleted:
            return "Deleted"
        elif not self.active:
            return "Banned"
        # ... other status checks
```

### Admin Function Logic
```python
@app.route('/admin', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
@role_required('admin')
def admin():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if action == 'delete_user':
            user_to_modify.deleted = True  # Soft delete
            # Auto-cancel bookings logic
            
        elif action == 'toggle_ban':
            user_to_modify.active = not user_to_modify.active
            # Auto-cancel bookings for banned users
    
    # Display users: active and banned separately
    users = User.query.filter_by(deleted=False).all()
    banned_users = User.query.filter_by(deleted=False, active=False).all()
```

### Booking System Integration
- **Booking Queries**: All booking queries filter out deleted and banned users
- **Overlap Checks**: Availability checks exclude deleted/banned users
- **Action Handlers**: Booking actions verify user status before processing

```python
# Example: Seeker's bookings exclude deleted/banned escorts
bookings_data = Booking.query.join(User, Booking.escort_id == User.id).filter(
    Booking.seeker_id == user_id,
    User.deleted == False,
    User.active == True
).order_by(Booking.start_time.desc()).all()
```

### Authentication Integration
- Login checks prevent deleted users from accessing the system
- Session management respects user status

### Browse System Integration
- Profile listings exclude deleted and banned users
- View profile functionality handles deleted users gracefully

## File Changes Made

### Core Application Files
1. **`app.py`**
   - Updated admin function to handle soft delete and ban
   - Added booking auto-cancellation logic
   - Added user feedback for admin actions

2. **`blueprint/models.py`**
   - Added helper methods: `is_available()`, `get_display_name()`, `get_account_status()`
   - Enhanced User model with status checking capabilities

3. **`blueprint/booking.py`**
   - Updated all booking queries to exclude deleted/banned users
   - Modified booking action handlers to verify user status
   - Updated overlap checking logic

4. **`templates/admin.html`**
   - Redesigned to show active and banned users separately
   - Added visual indicators and improved user feedback
   - Enhanced action buttons with confirmation dialogs

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Preservation**: Soft delete preserves data for audit trails
2. **Booking Integrity**: Automatic cancellation prevents orphaned bookings
3. **Access Control**: Multiple layers prevent deleted/banned user access
4. **Admin Oversight**: Clear admin interface for user management

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Maintains relational data while hiding users
2. **Audit Trail**: Deleted users remain in database for historical records
3. **Booking Management**: Automatic handling of affected bookings
4. **User Experience**: Clear admin interface with proper feedback
5. **Security**: Multiple validation layers prevent unauthorized access

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Admin Actions**: Test delete and ban functions with various user states
2. **Booking Impact**: Verify booking cancellation when users are deleted/banned
3. **Browse Functionality**: Confirm deleted/banned users don't appear in listings
4. **Authentication**: Verify deleted/banned users cannot log in
5. **Edge Cases**: Test scenarios with already cancelled bookings, etc.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Recovery System**: Allow undeleting users (set deleted=False)
2. **Audit Logging**: Track admin actions with timestamps
3. **Bulk Operations**: Allow bulk delete/ban operations
4. **Notification System**: Notify users when their bookings are cancelled
5. **Reporting**: Generate reports on user deletions and bans
